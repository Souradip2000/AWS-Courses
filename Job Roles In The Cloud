Concerns while shifting:
  - how AWS can free up employee time to focus on innovation
  - how job roles will change 
  - how high level job roles in on premesis IT Department will migrate to the AWS Cloud



The traditional on-premises model for managing IT applications and infrastructure is:  
  - highly manual  
  - often uses expensive equipment at less than full capacity.



AWS Cloud environment helps businesses drive innovation because of its ability to increase development speed and provide near-limitless scale.



It provides :
  - speed
  - scale
  - innovation
  - productivity

Speed: 
With the AWS Cloud, organizations can experiment with applications and new business models at lower cost and greater speed. 

Scale: 
The AWS Cloud creates opportunities for organizations to scale products almost instantaneously to a broader set of customer segments, 
geographies, and channels.     

Innovation: 
Using the AWS Cloud means that roles that were once required for on premises will move to a shared responsibility model. This frees up your 
team to innovate and use technologies such as advanced analytics, IoT, etc.

Productivity: 
The adoption of cloud principles such as infrastructure and security as code helps to automate compliance and other routine processes, which speeds up 
productivity. 


AWS Shared Responsibility model:
  - This shared model can help relieve customers' operational burden.
