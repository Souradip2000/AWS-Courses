Summary:

Cloud computing is the on-demand supply of IT resources over the internet, with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Cloud deployment models:
    1. Cloud-based deployment
    2. On-premises deployment
    3. Hybrid deployment

Cloud computing service models:
    1. IaaS : Infrastructure-as-a-Service
    2. PaaS : Platform-as-a-Service
    3. SaaS : Software-as-a-Service

Benefits of cloud computing:
    1. Pay-as-you-go pricing
    2. instant scalability
    3. deploy globally with low latency
    4. benefit from lower prices because there are many users
    5. increase speed and agility ; freedom to do things

Introduction:

Almost all modern computing is based on the client-server model.

Let's understand with the help of an example:

There's a coffee shop and a customer comes and places a request for a coffee.
Request = maybe the rain pattern analysis in South Africa/ the x rays of your elbow

Server part in AWS  is called :     Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud( EC2 )
An EC2 instance is a virtual server.

In the example, a request was made, the server validates the request( in this example the customer has paid the bill ) and responds with the answer 
i.e. the coffee.

Key value:
1. pay for what you use

In computing, a client can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. 
A server can be services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) – a type of virtual server.

What is Cloud Computing?
ans: the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet, with pay-as-you go pricing

Heavy lifting of IT:
the computer we are running MySQL dosen't differentiate a business from its verticals
how they are storing the data in the tables is what differentiates them
AWS helps regarding the first so that businesses can focus on the second
other advantages are instant scalability
why pay for developer environments on weekends when developers are on not working

3 cloud computing deployment models:
  i.   cloud-based
  ii.  on-premises
  iii. hybrid



i. Cloud based deployment:

  -  Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
  -  Migrate existing applications to the cloud.
  -  Design and build new applications in the cloud.
In a cloud-based deployment model, you can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new applications in the cloud. 
You can build those applications on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them. 
Alternatively, you can build them using higher-level services that reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of the core infrastructure.

For example, a company might create an application consisting of virtual servers, databases, and networking components that are fully based in the cloud.


ii. On-premises deployment:
Also known as privated cloud.
Deploy resources by using virtualisation and resource management tools
increase resource utilization by using the above

This model is much like the legacy IT infrastructure. Its incorporation of virtualisation and resource mgmt tools differentiates it and gives it an edge over...


iii. Hybrid deployment
We connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure and
integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT solutions

Useful if there are certain applicatons that run better on on-premises infrastructure or some government regulations require the business to keep certain
data on premises.


Benefits of Cloud computing:
1. pay as you go pricing
2. instant scalability
3. benefit from lower prices because there are many users
4. increased speed and agility
5. go global in minutes with low latency



Service models of cloud computing:

IaaS  :  Infrastructure-as-a-Service
It contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT
Provides access to:
        networking features
        data storage
        computers

PaaS  :  Platform-as-a-Service
Platform as a Service (PaaS) removes the need for you to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you 
to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. 

This helps you be more efficient because you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, 
or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.


Saas  : Software-as-a-Service
Software as a Service (SaaS) provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. 
In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications. 

With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; 
you only need to think about how you will use that piece of software. 

A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email which you can use to send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to 
the email product or maintain the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.
