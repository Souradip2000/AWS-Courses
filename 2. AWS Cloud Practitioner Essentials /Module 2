Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):

In client-server model, client sends a request, server does some work and sends a response.

You need raw compute capacity to host your applications and provide the compute power that your business needs. 
When you're working with AWS, those servers are virtual. 
This service you use to gain access to virtual servers is called EC2.
